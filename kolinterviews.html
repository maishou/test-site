<p>
HTuO Biosciences is a deep tech company, developing an advanced molecular simulation capable of accurately predicting the behaviour of molecules with applications in drug optimization.  Our core technology is a novel physics-based force field that combines reactive and polarizable methods to better handle a variety of features from Hydrogen bonding and auto-ionization to induced charge interactions.  When complete, HTuO's platform will enable chemists to understand how and why each functional group interacts with the intended target, and generate actionable insight.  This makes it possible to explore a broader range of targets with greater confidence.
<br><br>
As part of our preparations to "Go-To-Market", HTuO is interviewing industry experts to define the critical steps and financial considerations of Computer-Aided Drug Design.
